This file contains code I wrote in Python

The INFO1110 folder keeps my first ever basic game.

It runs on the Terminal and the aim of the game is to get from one point to another. 

Have a look at the images within the folder!\

Project 1 folder is an analysis about car crashes in NSW. For data cleaning and analysis, we used python here.\

For more information, read the report!\

Project 2 is similar to project one, but there were two datasets that has been used.\

We compared the car crashes in NSW with car crashes in the US.
