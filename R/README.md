# R projects in First and Second Years

These are the projects I have done in first and second years

To view the html files created by the rmd files, please open the following webpage on a new tab:

1. http://htmlpreview.github.io/

2. choose an html file from the HTML folder and click on it

3. copy the URL

4. paste the URL in the http://htmlpreview.github.io/

Note that the rmd file only shows the codes, but since the data is not in the GitHub, you can't knit the rmd file.
